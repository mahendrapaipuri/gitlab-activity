# Usage

## Auth token

`gitlab-activity` uses the GitLab API to pull information about a repositoryâ€™s activity.
The token is **required** to be able to use the tool. Here are instructions to generate
and use a GitLab access token for use with `gitlab-activity`.

- Go to [GitLab Access Tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens) and
  create a token with `read_api` scope.
- Then user can set an environment variable `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the created
  token and invoke `gitlab-activity` CLI.
- If there is no environment variable `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`, nor a token is passed
  using CLI option `--auth <token>`, the tool tries to get the token from
  `glab auth status -t` command if `glab` is installed.

## CLI options

The tool can be used to get variety of activity. All the following commands assume that user has set up an environment variable `GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Some of the examples are:

- Get activity of the repo `repo` in namespace `ns` between `2023-01-01` and
  `2023-10-10`

```
gitlab-activity -t ns/repo --since 2023-01-01 --until 2023-10-10
```

- By default, the tool outputs only MR activity. To include issues as well use

```
gitlab-activity -t ns/repo --since 2023-01-01 --until 2023-10-10 --activity issues --activity merge_requests
```

- To include MRs and issues that are open as well, use

```
gitlab-activity -t ns/repo --since 2023-01-01 --until 2023-10-10 --activity issues --activity merge_requests --include-opened
```

- To include list of contributors at the end of each entry

```
gitlab-activity -t ns/repo --since 2023-01-01 --until 2023-10-10 --activity issues --activity merge_requests --include-opened --include-contributors-list
```

- By default, the activity is printed to standard `stdout`, _i.e.,_ terminal. To create a file with activity, use

```
gitlab-activity -t ns/repo --since 2023-01-01 --until 2023-10-10 --activity issues --activity merge_requests --include-opened --include-contributors-list --output ACTIVITYLOG.md
```

- To get all the MRs since beginning until now use,

```
gitlab-activity -t ns/repo --all --output CHANGELOG.md
```

- To get MRs since last tag and append to the existing `CHANGELOG.md`. Note that `CHANGELOG.md` should have a marker `<!-- <START NEW CHANGELOG ENTRY> -->` to indicate where to add the activity data.

```
gitlab-activity -t ns/repo --append --output CHANGELOG.md
```

## Contributors list

`gitlab-activity` outputs the contributors list, if asked, at the end of each tag entry in the changelog file. The list of contributors are estimated in the following way:

- Author of the MR is always a contributor by default
- All the MR's [participants](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#mergerequestparticipant) will be added to the contributors list.
- If there are any bot accounts in the participants, they will be removed. Bot accounts are identified based on the config provided by the user and GitLab API marking the user as bot or not. In addition, if there are usernames with "bot" in them, they will be excluded in the list too.

Finally, all the unique contributors from each MR will be added at the end of each MR entry.
